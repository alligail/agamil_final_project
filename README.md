<b>CMPS 369 Final Project </b>

This project will combine all that you've done for your projects, but integrate and add on to them, making use of topics we've covered during 
the last month of the semester. Most importantly, you have the freedom to create this application however you want. 

<b>Serverside / Client Side</b>
  - You may use traditional server-side rendering with limited client-side JavaScript
  - You may implement with Vue as a single page application
  - You may use a blend of the approaches - perhaps using Vue to do the map page, while traditional server side rendering for contact list edit / delete

<b>Database</b>
  - Used SQLite to interact with database
  - Created my database on startup if it does not exist
  - Hashed passwords

<b>URL Structure and User Flow </b>
  - URL name and domained created through render.com and Namecheap
  - Users should easily understand how to login, logout, view the main contact page, ane make eduts
